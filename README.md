IRMC
=======
IRMC (Internet Relay Minecraft Chat, or Internet Relay MineCraft - I just wanted it to include MC, 'kay?) is a Bukkit server plugin that allows in-game to irc chat, in-game to irc commands, irc to in-game chat and irc to in-game commands. We plan on including some awesome shit in this, so keep updated.
